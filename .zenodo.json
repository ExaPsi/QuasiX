  "title": "QuasiX: A High-Performance Rust Implementation of GW and Bethe-Salpeter Equation Methods with Seamless Python Integration",
  "description": "QuasiX is a high-performance implementation of the GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) methods for accurate quasiparticle and optical excitation calculations. The Rust core provides 8-40x speedup over pure Python implementations while maintaining seamless integration with PySCF. Key features include G0W0 and evGW with DIIS acceleration (100% GW100 convergence), Newton-Raphson quasiparticle solvers (77% accuracy improvement over linearization), contour deformation and analytic continuation frequency integration, and BSE-TDA with Davidson solver.",
